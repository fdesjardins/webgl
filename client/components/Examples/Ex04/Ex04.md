>
> WebGL is a very verbose API. Setting up shaders, buffers, attributes and uniforms
> takes a lot of code. A simple lit cube in WebGL might easily take over 60 calls into WebGL.

> At its core there's really only a few main functions
>
> *   `twgl.createProgramInfo` compiles a shader and creates setters for attribs and uniforms
> *   `twgl.createBufferInfoFromArrays` creates buffers and attribute settings
> *   `twgl.setBuffersAndAttributes` binds buffers and sets attributes
> *   `twgl.setUniforms` sets the uniforms
> *   `twgl.createTextures` creates textures of various sorts
> *   `twgl.createFramebufferInfo` creates a framebuffer and attachments.
