## The Schrödinger Equation

The dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system are governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} =
  \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V_\psi
$$
